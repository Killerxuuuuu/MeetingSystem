[0.00s -> 31.00s] Speaker 0:  Okay, who wants to take notes today?
[30.00s -> 32.00s] Speaker 1:  Thank you.
[31.00s -> 39.00s] Speaker 0:  Okay. Okay.
[38.00s -> 44.00s] Speaker 1:  Okay, I could take notes this time, I guess. What? I'll take notes this time. Okay.
[43.00s -> 45.00s] Speaker 0:  It's okay.
[44.00s -> 47.00s] Speaker 1:  I'll make funny drawings.
[46.00s -> 48.00s] Speaker 0:  make funny drawings.
[47.00s -> 62.00s] Speaker 1:  Actually, first thing, I just sort of did a really sort of brief version of what we have to do.
[61.00s -> 86.00s] Speaker 0:  Thank you. Very interesting start of the meeting. Yes.
[85.00s -> 87.00s] Speaker 1:  Yes.
[86.00s -> 125.00s] Speaker 0:  Everyone's looking now, reading. Okay? Yep. I like the timeline.
[124.00s -> 131.00s] Speaker 1:  actually for that I was just copying the one straight out of the other document so it's all whatever
[130.00s -> 138.00s] Speaker 0:  Okay, yeah.
[137.00s -> 140.00s] Speaker 1:  Okay, yep, basically that's fine.
[139.00s -> 150.00s] Speaker 0:  I'm not sure if we need the outline of the prototype I mean what we're going to put into
[149.00s -> 155.00s] Speaker 1:  What are we gonna put into that? Well, just sort of. Well, the thing is, yeah, we're gonna be touching on all that during the other part for the progress. Yeah, because I'm. Yeah.
[154.00s -> 158.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, because that's basically what we're doing here, isn't it?
[157.00s -> 176.00s] Speaker 1:  Yeah, well it's just something that he had mentioned in the in the previous like just to sort of have a prototype together and so just saying that you know we could potentially do that. Yeah we could. It's not something we have to. This could be just some a little just just describe some screenshots.
[175.00s -> 177.00s] Speaker 0:  Thank you.
[176.00s -> 195.00s] Speaker 1:  Yeah, sure. Like the thing is, I was thinking even in the stuff that I was doing, I mean just throw the screenshots in there when you talk about what you're doing. Yeah, you can either, we can just ignore that. Oh yes, actually I have that at the very end, screenshots, but that didn't show up on this page, so it's not even relevant. Yeah, it says screenshot and stuff.
[194.00s -> 198.00s] Speaker 0:  We could have screenshots by the thing, each one, or...
[197.00s -> 200.00s] Speaker 1:  I have just a bunch of them in one section.
[199.00s -> 201.00s] Speaker 0:  of them in one section.
[200.00s -> 231.00s] Speaker 1:  Anyways, so yeah, this is just very general structure. I guess from this, we can just pop in our little blurbs. Yeah. I've written the topic segmentation one. Cool. So I don't know if there's other stuff that you think should be done to this. I could do that before I mail it to you guys. Otherwise, no. Does someone else want to throw it together? Actually, I can probably still throw it together if you want. Put your parts into this one. I think Penelope should do it.
[230.00s -> 232.00s] Speaker 0:  I think Penelope should do it.
[231.00s -> 234.00s] Speaker 1:  Perfectionist price.
[233.00s -> 235.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah. Yeah.
[235.00s -> 237.00s] Speaker 0:  That's a good idea.
[236.00s -> 240.00s] Speaker 1:  That's a good idea. Let's just cut out the middle man. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
[239.00s -> 253.00s] Speaker 0:  She's not even going to tell us we're going wrong anyway. And I'm being like, I don't know, I'm not a native speaker of English.
[252.00s -> 254.00s] Speaker 1:  Thank you.
[253.00s -> 287.00s] Speaker 0:  It's up to you if you want to keep going with that. I'm happy to do some as well. I have lots of time tonight. And then we'll send it to you. You can do the final review. I'll look at it when my usual working hours are from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock or something. I know, you're always online. It always makes me feel bad because when I go to bed at 1 o'clock, you're still online. You never go to bed.
[286.00s -> 289.00s] Speaker 1:  Or just leave your computer on, maybe.
[288.00s -> 298.00s] Speaker 0:  He pretends to be always busy, but I'm never online in the morning, so...
[297.00s -> 302.00s] Speaker 1:  I noticed that no one is.
[301.00s -> 304.00s] Speaker 0:  Thank you. All right. Yeah. So.
[303.00s -> 307.00s] Speaker 1:  Okay, so I'll send it off to you.
[306.00s -> 317.00s] Speaker 0:  I know. Yeah, do what you want to do with it first and then I'll send it out to you again.
[316.00s -> 327.00s] Speaker 1:  Was there anything else we wanted to add to the timeline? I mean, essentially was what, like, you can't see it right there. Here's the old one. Oh, there's more. Well, that's this original one. Oh, this is.
[326.00s -> 328.00s] Speaker 0:  Oh, this is the one that okay? Yeah?
[327.00s -> 331.00s] Speaker 1:  The one that, okay. Yeah, yeah, which just copied straight out.
[330.00s -> 359.00s] Speaker 0:  We probably want to think about if we want to change our goals and stuff. I think one thing that we could probably skip totally is the removing things from the audio files. That's what I thought as well. I mean, are we actually going to attempt that? No, I don't think so. I don't think so either. That's too big. Yeah. I think that's going to be... We don't even know how to approach that at the moment, I think. Yeah. We don't even have to say...
[358.00s -> 362.00s] Speaker 1:  have to say what we could have done if we had more time, good future work things.
[361.00s -> 365.00s] Speaker 0:  good future work things and it's taking the conclusion yeah it's a fun report
[364.00s -> 366.00s] Speaker 1:  report. Should have we had more time.
[365.00s -> 369.00s] Speaker 0:  if we had more time. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
[368.00s -> 372.00s] Speaker 1:  Unless we discover some sort of time warp thing, it's not gonna happen.
[371.00s -> 389.00s] Speaker 0:  yeah but that's definitely one thing so maybe i mean we should we should definitely well we could probably not put it under this heading but put it under changes since the initial specification yeah and say you know we didn't we decided the time is too short
[388.00s -> 390.00s] Speaker 1:  Always felt they were more important
[389.00s -> 391.00s] Speaker 0:  there are more important things to do in our time.
[390.00s -> 392.00s] Speaker 1:  and things to do without time. Yes, I'm not.
[391.00s -> 412.00s] Speaker 0:  and then didn't worry about. We prefer to concentrate on the main. And I think we should probably comment explicitly on the milestones here as well and say, we managed to do. Yeah.
[411.00s -> 418.00s] Speaker 1:  yeah this this and this or some of them are a bit later somewhere yeah yeah
[417.00s -> 426.00s] Speaker 0:  I'm like, we haven't really... We've developed prototype GUI, which is, you know... Exactly. Best file on target or something.
[425.00s -> 427.00s] Speaker 1:  I'll get yeah
[426.00s -> 429.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, yeah. It's more or less. Yeah. But it's pretty good.
[428.00s -> 431.00s] Speaker 1:  That was good. That was good. Well, plus or minus.
[430.00s -> 446.00s] Speaker 0:  Plus or minus three days. He doesn't have to know exactly. Yeah, that's true. I mean, yeah, I mean, it's not finished, but. So I've only got six days to do the topic segment. Jesus. That's funny.
[445.00s -> 450.00s] Speaker 1:  You don't have any SPNLP assignments, do you?
[449.00s -> 451.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah.
[450.00s -> 452.00s] Speaker 1:  Thanks for watching!
[451.00s -> 462.00s] Speaker 0:  And you can say, yeah, we're still aiming for the development to be completely unimarturated. Speaking characterisation is supposed to be done already.
[461.00s -> 464.00s] Speaker 1:  It's supposed to be done already. Oh, really? Yeah two days
[463.00s -> 465.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, two days ago.
[464.00s -> 473.00s] Speaker 1:  Are one of those something that you want to change and delete from our list of expectations?
[472.00s -> 476.00s] Speaker 0:  Give me a week and I'll tell you the answer.
[475.00s -> 480.00s] Speaker 1:  Should we put a hint that something like that might happen into the document?
[479.00s -> 481.00s] Speaker 0:  Maybe the speaker characterization might get...
[480.00s -> 482.00s] Speaker 1:  characterization may get slimmer. Yeah.
[481.00s -> 499.00s] Speaker 0:  slimmer. Yeah, that's right. I really want to do it. It's not going to be difficult if at least have all the information pop up that is already in the metadata file. That's going to be new work. That's true. So it's definitely going to be something there. We won't make it disappear, but we might thin it down a bit.
[498.00s -> 500.00s] Speaker 1:  But we might not.
[499.00s -> 511.00s] Speaker 0:  But we might not, you never know, we might have time, it depends on how we have the time. Yeah, they might turn out easier than we thought. The topic segmentation with LCC.
[510.00s -> 512.00s] Speaker 1:  I'll see you next time.
[511.00s -> 515.00s] Speaker 0:  and textiles basically done, it just needs to be.
[514.00s -> 517.00s] Speaker 1:  to be.
[516.00s -> 520.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, tune, search the parameter space, man.
[519.00s -> 521.00s] Speaker 1:  Peace, man. Awesome. That was it.
[520.00s -> 549.00s] Speaker 0:  Let's see what happens. Yeah, sounds good. Should we change? Sorry, we should probably do another responsibility of packages as well. That's what he hinted that we should also indicate who is responsible for what. Right.
[548.00s -> 558.00s] Speaker 1:  for what, from now on. Well, I could probably just copy that straight over to the other one as well. Yeah, pretty much. That's essentially the same as it was. More detailed, specifically. Well, you can.
[557.00s -> 584.00s] Speaker 0:  Specifically where you could put, you know, you know, I don't know. Yeah, should we? I don't know. We think, Mike, about our things that we have together. Should we put those apart? Yeah, I mean, we have it now. Like you've heard it and you have the other. But what about them? Remove this.
[583.00s -> 589.00s] Speaker 1:  Well, if we're skipping the audio one, then it's not easier.
[588.00s -> 594.00s] Speaker 0:  We'll just keep it together on the paper there right now and just see what what
[593.00s -> 596.00s] Speaker 1:  and just see what, what? Have you taken any more of a look at it? No.
[595.00s -> 599.00s] Speaker 0:  Cut it? At the distance? No, not at the distance, yes. Okay.
[598.00s -> 600.00s] Speaker 1:  We could probably...
[599.00s -> 601.00s] Speaker 0:  Thank you very much. Have a great day.
[600.00s -> 604.00s] Speaker 1:  I don't know if we'll have time to look at that before tomorrow.
[603.00s -> 607.00s] Speaker 0:  tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah, it might be. Yeah.
[606.00s -> 615.00s] Speaker 1:  Like I'll claim one, you claim the other for the search things, and then we can leave that one as a joint one. Yeah. That might be good. Okay. Something.
[614.00s -> 618.00s] Speaker 0:  Have you managed any further on the search thing?
[617.00s -> 640.00s] Speaker 1:  I found finally today something that I can build it in and it I should have something for tomorrow I should at least very least have a GUI where I'll be wiring that in hopefully tomorrow morning so I want to get something I want to see this I want to get it together I have an image in my mind
[639.00s -> 653.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, my intent is to work on these things tomorrow a bit more as well, so I don't know if we send it in in the afternoon. Maybe I can add a few sentences to what I've done. Well, it doesn't really matter.
[652.00s -> 659.00s] Speaker 1:  It doesn't really matter. I mean, you can write the sentences first as well. I mean, with the intention that this is done.
[658.00s -> 662.00s] Speaker 0:  This is done, and also, sometimes it's a bit of a motivating...
[661.00s -> 668.00s] Speaker 1:  Sometimes it's a bit of a motivating factor, too. I mean, you write down the words, and the idea says, oh, okay, we'll do this, we'll do that. All falls together.
[667.00s -> 669.00s] Speaker 0:  All falls together. How about the un...
[668.00s -> 671.00s] Speaker 1:  How about the underlying data for...
[670.00s -> 675.00s] Speaker 0:  data for it, for the inverted file as I'm coming along.
[674.00s -> 676.00s] Speaker 1:  That's what I'm coming up on. Well.
[675.00s -> 706.00s] Speaker 0:  well I still like struggling with Java stuff I think I was wondering about that is I haven't looked at it so much but if you guys know how we could do that like from the extract words that you did like also in extract time stamps and easy yeah we're just when he pulls up the segments yeah
[705.00s -> 707.00s] Speaker 1:  Yeah.
[706.00s -> 708.00s] Speaker 0:  Um...
[707.00s -> 709.00s] Speaker 1:  Part of that, one of the
[708.00s -> 725.00s] Speaker 0:  part of that one of those one of the attributes if you do get attributes call them attributes it returns a list of attributes search through those and then just you can that will tell you what attributes it's got okay and then you give it automatically or you can just hard code and say look get me the timestamps so you just say
[724.00s -> 726.00s] Speaker 1:  So you just say
[725.00s -> 730.00s] Speaker 0:  get attribute and put, I think the method's called get attribute.
[729.00s -> 731.00s] Speaker 1:  attribute. It's called start time.
[730.00s -> 746.00s] Speaker 0:  it's called start time and end time okay and that will tell you the start times and end times okay i think it returns a double okay yeah so now i could just put it in some yeah that's on the
[745.00s -> 748.00s] Speaker 1:  on the non-right element.
[747.00s -> 756.00s] Speaker 0:  right elements. What on the? The object is a non-right element I think. Okay.
[755.00s -> 758.00s] Speaker 1:  That's it, tell me what you want to do.
[757.00s -> 773.00s] Speaker 0:  Anyway, yeah, I'll take a look at that So is there did you have you made another end browser is there something?
[772.00s -> 786.00s] Speaker 1:  there is but I haven't made a lot of changes to it so I might just delete what I've done and copy again from yours because I'm sure you've probably made some changes already
[785.00s -> 787.00s] Speaker 0:  But I will tonight, that's the plan.
[786.00s -> 796.00s] Speaker 1:  Alright, I see. I thought you said that you had written some things that maybe have caused some bugs and that you were going to fix those on the weekend or something? No.
[795.00s -> 801.00s] Speaker 0:  No, after the weekend, the weekend was out.
[800.00s -> 843.00s] Speaker 1:  Yeah, so if you're, although there's stuff out there that, actually I'm gonna try and minimize the amount of changes that make Dan browser anyways, shouldn't be an issue. Actually, just to clarify, last week when we were talking about our search results, like if we have topics as well as transcripts, as well as what was the other, summaries, do we want separate result panes for each of those, or do we want them all in one pane with like an icon or a different color or something to indicate what type of result they are, so that when they click on that, it's gonna go to the relevant thing. Like just, if they check all three, say, topics, summaries, blah, blah, blah, have three different windows come up? Or three, like some pane. Well, at the moment,
[842.00s -> 852.00s] Speaker 0:  At the moment, is there a window that comes up or is there a second result of pain or is there, you know, does the window get larger?
[851.00s -> 884.00s] Speaker 1:  Um, I thought what we sort of discussed last week was to have it sort of on the same window. Um, so it'll be on the search window, bottom half of the search window. Um, I don't know if we still want to keep it that way, but that's, uh, that's what I was going to be working with. So it's just like you click those and it just loads up, you know, splits that thing into two or three or whatever it is. One, two or three, depending on which ones you check. And then, um, so if we want to do it that way, you know, like it probably doesn't matter too much. Just trying to think if there's going to be any other issues down the road, um, depending on. Well, have you confused?
[883.00s -> 888.00s] Speaker 0:  You confused me. Do you have three separate windows for the three separate different types?
[887.00s -> 893.00s] Speaker 1:  three separate different types of no just just pains just result pains okay not three different no no no
[892.00s -> 895.00s] Speaker 0:  No. No. No. No. No. No.
[894.00s -> 905.00s] Speaker 1:  So it's just when we click, you know, topics and summaries for what we want to search then a little, you know, there'll be two result panes. Yeah. So one for topics, one for... I don't know. Not really tabs. I quite like...
[904.00s -> 906.00s] Speaker 0:  I quite like the idea of a tab.
[905.00s -> 909.00s] Speaker 1:  But then you can't see all of them at the same time.
[908.00s -> 914.00s] Speaker 0:  But you wouldn't want to compare one topic result with one summary result, would you?
[913.00s -> 919.00s] Speaker 1:  Well, it's no but the thing is if you're looking if you check them both you want to see all the results
[918.00s -> 923.00s] Speaker 0:  especially if you get results for the same meeting. Yeah, exactly.
[922.00s -> 933.00s] Speaker 1:  Exactly. Yeah. So the summary and the topic and the transcript. That's true. So, or we could just put them all into one result pane on that same window.
[932.00s -> 936.00s] Speaker 0:  I mean, we could order them by meeting, for example.
[935.00s -> 941.00s] Speaker 1:  Oh yeah, I guess that was the other thing, whether we want to have this reorder by columns.
[940.00s -> 947.00s] Speaker 0:  The first question is do we want to order them, how do we want to order them in the first place?
[946.00s -> 957.00s] Speaker 1:  in the first place. I think, yeah, probably by meeting makes most sense. I mean, essentially they're in time order. So, yeah, that kind of makes most sense.
[956.00s -> 962.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, maybe we should do that. Yeah. Yeah.
[961.00s -> 967.00s] Speaker 1:  Yeah, should be an easy, no, I don't know, actually. Should be fairly easy, I guess.
[966.00s -> 989.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, why don't you just, um, color code those, the results too.
[988.00s -> 1013.00s] Speaker 1:  the results to... Sometimes in a case like that, like I've run across in other languages, just that it's hard to tell what kind of object it was originally, once it's put into like a list box or something. It's hard to tell whether it was a transcript or whatever. And then if we're highlighting something in a transcript window, it may be difficult to get that information back once it's just in a list box, an item in a list box. So.
[1012.00s -> 1015.00s] Speaker 0:  So, let's...
[1014.00s -> 1017.00s] Speaker 1:  Where's if it's coming from? If you do it...
[1016.00s -> 1033.00s] Speaker 0:  if you do it straight from you know you get you get the result and then there's some if statements saying straight on the you know rock bottom level saying if if you found a segment then colorate print it as opposed to
[1032.00s -> 1059.00s] Speaker 1:  Yeah, it's just like from past experience, there's goofy little things that happen and it just doesn't let you save certain things and it's just kind of trying to do a different kind of, to go to a different window. So if you wanna go to the actual highlight the transcript or highlight the topic or highlight the summary, at that point, that's sort of where it starts getting a little bit tricky because you're working with an event handler within the one panel or a list box or whatever it is. And.
[1058.00s -> 1061.00s] Speaker 0:  Oh, I see, yeah.
[1060.00s -> 1070.00s] Speaker 1:  There are ways around it, but you know, whether I'll be able to figure something out before tomorrow, you know, or delegates or whatever.
[1069.00s -> 1078.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, I mean, at the moment it works with highlighting in the transcript window, doesn't it?
[1077.00s -> 1090.00s] Speaker 1:  I think he was saying that as long as we implement that interface, it should work with anything that we do, like highlighting, you know, I think that was, who was saying?
[1089.00s -> 1092.00s] Speaker 0:  Who is saying that? What do you mean it should work with anyone?
[1091.00s -> 1105.00s] Speaker 1:  wasn't Jonathan saying something about that I think it was just like as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window we should be able to have that highlighting happen
[1104.00s -> 1136.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, I mean the whole, what fills the transcription box and all of these boxes is a special sort of pain made by night, so I'm not sure what it's called now. And that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well, as I said, you know, if you left click on something, for example, it highlights automatically. So maybe it comes with something clever as well.
[1135.00s -> 1140.00s] Speaker 1:  Maybe I should use that as well in one. Yeah. Yeah. OK.
[1139.00s -> 1158.00s] Speaker 0:  It's called a night text pane or something, is it? No, I'm sure there's a lot of pain in it. Night, I don't know. Text area. Yeah, something like that. Nom text areas. Most of these are called nom. Yeah, what's nom anyway? Night object model, I think.
[1157.00s -> 1160.00s] Speaker 1:  Okay, that makes sense.
[1159.00s -> 1164.00s] Speaker 0:  What is it? Night object model, I think. That's what I think. Ha ha ha.
[1163.00s -> 1165.00s] Speaker 1:  Thank you. Thank you.
[1164.00s -> 1187.00s] Speaker 0:  With the removing the dis-fluencies, have you done anything with that yet? Anybody? Nobody? No. No.
[1186.00s -> 1188.00s] Speaker 1:  No. No, we haven't. Because I...
[1187.00s -> 1189.00s] Speaker 0:  Because I'm
[1188.00s -> 1191.00s] Speaker 1:  I was wondering how we're going to...
[1190.00s -> 1200.00s] Speaker 0:  how we're gonna write it back to HTML I mean XML if we take if we did the processing writing it back to XML
[1199.00s -> 1214.00s] Speaker 1:  XML. I thought we were just going to have that as words like not even not as XML just sort of as a text. What was that? Text file. Transcript. No because then we need all the other data if we want to keep it a transcript.
[1213.00s -> 1216.00s] Speaker 0:  It will very much limit what you can do with it if it's not.
[1215.00s -> 1218.00s] Speaker 1:  what you can do with it if it's non-example.
[1217.00s -> 1248.00s] Speaker 0:  There is some bizarre method that puts things back into XML for us. Why do we want it in XML though? I thought we would just selectively write the XML that we've got. So as opposed to... Oh, select what we want, just take bits of the XML, only take certain segments. Yeah, only print out certain segments, the segments that we want, just selectively. At the moment it prints out all of them. We've just got an if loop in it that leaves out some of the print segments.
[1247.00s -> 1249.00s] Speaker 1:  about some of the print statements. Yeah, yeah.
[1248.00s -> 1252.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, not not store it at all. Whatever. Okay
[1251.00s -> 1253.00s] Speaker 1:  Okay. Is that all you have? Yeah.
[1252.00s -> 1255.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, that's what I think we...
[1254.00s -> 1258.00s] Speaker 1:  That's what we were thinking before.
[1257.00s -> 1259.00s] Speaker 0:  we're thinking of one.
[1258.00s -> 1261.00s] Speaker 1:  Actually, but this makes more sense.
[1260.00s -> 1265.00s] Speaker 0:  But that will mean that you can only do things on actually now because you can do things on word level
[1264.00s -> 1269.00s] Speaker 1:  things on word level so yeah that's fine. Yeah if we're gonna do the XML then fine.
[1268.00s -> 1297.00s] Speaker 0:  we're not really well I mean we're not going to do much more than just look at the like the text will remove these fluencies because we're not going to search it and we're not gonna like listen to it since we're not doing the audio thing yeah so I guess just displaying it is right yeah you need to do much more with it
[1296.00s -> 1304.00s] Speaker 1:  I think it's like, well, how would we display the like, if we do take this fluencies out and just, you know, create a text file, take the disfluencies out of the text file.
[1303.00s -> 1309.00s] Speaker 0:  It would just be a blurb, like a summary. It won't look like, it won't say speaker X says this, speaker Y says that, speaker Z.
[1308.00s -> 1314.00s] Speaker 1:  Unless we extract that over to the file when we create the text file. Yeah, then it will look ugly probably.
[1313.00s -> 1365.00s] Speaker 0:  Then it will look ugly, probably, because it will look just black and white, unless you want it dark. It's probably the best thing to do, as you said. I don't think it's going to take long to produce anyway. I think it's true. I mean, these meetings are not endlessly long. It's just words, and to print all of them out selectively. It does it on the fly anyway, doesn't it? Yeah. So then it just goes through and says, if this word equals that, don't print. Yeah. Just a bunch of statements. You could nearly do it together with the original transcription, have them run parallel. So if it's a proper word, print it on both panes. And if it's not a proper word, then print it only on one. But I mean, that's fancy.
[1364.00s -> 1367.00s] Speaker 1:  Yeah, you probably could actually, that's probably not...
[1366.00s -> 1369.00s] Speaker 0:  That's probably not that difficult, you're just in fact in the code.
[1368.00s -> 1370.00s] Speaker 1:  just in fattening the code out a bit. Yeah.
[1369.00s -> 1402.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, but then, you know, the good way of doing it not together is that if someone doesn't want to look at the, you know, the chop file, then you don't ever have to produce it. But I mean, you can, you know, you can write, we can write something like, we'll try and do it on the fly and observe if that is going to take too long. If it's going to take too long, well, think about writing it to a file and doing it offline.
[1401.00s -> 1442.00s] Speaker 1:  They'd just be if statements when they do a fast if statements. I was just thinking as well, I mean, we could probably even use like XSLT to kind of just transform it and, you know, flip it into a... What's that? Just transforms like the style sheet, XML style sheet. Oh, right. And then it's kind of like there's usually things built in to, well, it should be built into Java, I mean, to process XML into, like it just creates whatever file it's going to be in. It's been a couple of years since I've looked into anything like this, but that might even be an easier way. And then that way we could even pre-process that beforehand. I don't know. Well, we don't want to have to do that, right? Although on the fly, it's typically...
[1441.00s -> 1445.00s] Speaker 0:  Even trying to read it in XML with Java was complicated.
[1444.00s -> 1448.00s] Speaker 1:  level was complicated enough. I gave up doing that completely.
[1447.00s -> 1452.00s] Speaker 0:  They vaulted back to night stuff because it was much, much, much easier.
[1451.00s -> 1453.00s] Speaker 1:  It's easier. Yeah. All right. So we.
[1452.00s -> 1455.00s] Speaker 0:  So if we can do it with night stuff, do it with night stuff.
[1454.00s -> 1456.00s] Speaker 1:  Yeah, we don't stop, hang on, why's it gonna be...
[1455.00s -> 1459.00s] Speaker 0:  I was trying to do it, it was just so complicated.
[1458.00s -> 1518.00s] Speaker 1:  It was so complicated, it was ridiculous. I can't believe it. You have to start defining object models like the night thing and getting all these all weird things on it, it was mad. Actually, I was thinking I might try and talk to, who is it, Jonathan and Gene? Like just to see what they, what system they use to develop this stuff. Cause it would be nice to have all the tools there and just like have the object model and just kind of like plug and play with everything and just to actually use a system, you know, at a higher level rather than kind of playing around with a little bit of code and modifying their code and doing this and that. It'd be nice to just sort of see what they're doing. So I might try and contact them, see if there's, I don't know, any other hints they could give us. Just to get things, I don't know, moving at a higher level, I guess. Just seems to be more interesting to use it as a real developer would. It just seems like a little tinkering here and there just adding a couple things.
[1517.00s -> 1521.00s] Speaker 0:  That's what programming is all about, I'm afraid.
[1520.00s -> 1532.00s] Speaker 1:  all about, I'm afraid. No, no, it shouldn't be. It should be higher level, it should be conceptual and coming up with the brilliant ideas and then just bringing those to reality.
[1531.00s -> 1536.00s] Speaker 0:  Maybe. Yeah, maybe. It's the higher people.
[1537.00s -> 1558.00s] Speaker 0:  Well, I mean, yeah, why don't you put both of those ideas into that paragraph and say you'll have a look at both or something, if you want to do it. I personally don't want to mess with writing files or anything at the moment. I want to do it superficially.
[1557.00s -> 1587.00s] Speaker 1:  like the thing that I was thinking there as well is that once it's done for, you know, one meeting, it's done. It's there, it's a file, text file or XML or whatever it is. But, you know, just, I don't know. Just, it doesn't make any difference really either way to me. It's like, if it's fast enough on the fly, then sure. That's about the only issue I have with on the fly, whether it's fast enough. Yeah. I expect it will be. Especially with Java and all this other crap. If it's loading the file and doing all the rest and processing them. It has already.
[1586.00s -> 1589.00s] Speaker 0:  Well, it has already loaded it anyway
[1588.00s -> 1598.00s] Speaker 1:  yeah it's after it's loaded it right it's just a it's just a for loop really it's really fine whether it runs out of memory yeah
[1597.00s -> 1601.00s] Speaker 0:  Okay.
[1600.00s -> 1602.00s] Speaker 1:  Thank you.
[1601.00s -> 1613.00s] Speaker 0:  So, shall we all write a letter or two about future work as well? Yeah, I included the future work in my own section.
[1612.00s -> 1616.00s] Speaker 1:  I just said, I said what I've done so far and what I'm going to do.
[1615.00s -> 1620.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, well, maybe you could split that up.
[1619.00s -> 1623.00s] Speaker 1:  Um, I'll look into each.
[1622.00s -> 1628.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, like here is what we've done already and then, you know, down here. Lose a bit of continuity if you do that.
[1627.00s -> 1630.00s] Speaker 1:  Maybe if you do that, that's what I was thinking. Sometimes it's easier to have the top.
[1629.00s -> 1634.00s] Speaker 0:  it's easier to have the top in its own intersections, if you know what I mean. So you talk about its weak characters and see what you've done with them.
[1633.00s -> 1642.00s] Speaker 1:  I think that does make sense, but maybe at the end, maybe just a point form of, you know, things that we're still working on, things that we'll do. Goals or something. Yeah, that's right.
[1641.00s -> 1648.00s] Speaker 0:  yeah that's right bullet bullet points yeah because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing you know yeah they're not together
[1647.00s -> 1650.00s] Speaker 1:  Yeah, they're not together you lose a lot of
[1649.00s -> 1652.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, maybe you're right.
[1651.00s -> 1653.00s] Speaker 1:  Thank you.
[1681.00s -> 1683.00s] Speaker 1:  Thanks for watching.
[1682.00s -> 1687.00s] Speaker 0:  Sounds good. Anything else?
[1686.00s -> 1688.00s] Speaker 1:  Anyone want to talk about?
[1687.00s -> 1712.00s] Speaker 0:  to talk about. We all have sleep over here, but how? Boom. Maybe asleep. So we're all still writing our summaries, sending them to you. You send it on to me.
[1711.00s -> 1721.00s] Speaker 1:  Or she'll just take, she can take it from now, doesn't matter. Or do you want to? Or no? Okay, I can, yeah sure if you want to send them to me, that's fine. I don't know.
[1720.00s -> 1722.00s] Speaker 0:  That's fine. I don't know, it doesn't matter to me. Yeah, okay. Thank you.
[1721.00s -> 1728.00s] Speaker 1:  doesn't matter to me either. Actually, that's a good idea. I'll take one quick look over, try and get it as good as I think that we. Yeah.
[1727.00s -> 1735.00s] Speaker 0:  you stick it together and she'll shine it yeah and then send it on to us so that we can nod
[1734.00s -> 1736.00s] Speaker 1:  Curly formality.
[1735.00s -> 1743.00s] Speaker 0:  Yeah, and correct back any things that I thought was wrong in English or whatever. It's like no.
[1742.00s -> 1745.00s] Speaker 1:  It's like, no. We're changing dialogue back.
[1744.00s -> 1746.00s] Speaker 0:  We'll be right back.
[1745.00s -> 1748.00s] Speaker 1:  Hello, Gene.
[1747.00s -> 1754.00s] Speaker 0:  I haven't used my pen.
[1754.00s -> 1764.00s] Speaker 0:  It was like four lines, so whatever. Okay. Yeah, 12.30 tomorrow with...
[1763.00s -> 1766.00s] Speaker 1:  with Steve O'Gaughan.
[1765.00s -> 1783.00s] Speaker 0:  Steve, oh god. Good job you're a man.
[1782.00s -> 1784.00s] Speaker 1:  I hope that is alright, yeah.
[1783.00s -> 1786.00s] Speaker 0:  That is alright, yeah, that much we like in the US.
